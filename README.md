## Web MIDI Keyboard Visualizer

This React app uses the [web-midi-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-midi-hooks) npm package to visualize data received from a connected MIDI keyboard. The `web-midi-hooks` package enables MIDI messages sent from the keyboard to be ingested using the Web MIDI API, and passed to components using React's Context api.
